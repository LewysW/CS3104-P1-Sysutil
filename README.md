# CS3104-P1-Sysutil
System utility practical for CS3104 Operating Systems module.

#Compilation
1. Open a command prompt in the practical directory containing the source file "myls.c" and the make file "Makefile"

2. Run the command "make" in the command line

3. If that doesn't work, try running "make clean" and then repeating the previous step

#Execution - System Utility
To execute the "ls -n" style system utility:

1. Open a command prompt in the directory containing the executable "myls"

2. Run the command "./myls <name of file or directory>" in the command line (one command line argument)

#Execution - Unit Tests
To execute the automated unit tests of the solution:

1. Open a command prompt in the directory containing the executable "myls"

2. Run the command "./myls" in the command line (no command line arguments)

#Troubleshooting
If the error message "myls: cannot access '<file name>': No such file or directory" is displayed, the file/directory specified as an argument most likely does not exist.
